## 🎯 Active Sprint

### Sprint 14: GenAI Predictor Design

**Goal**: Design and prototype the GenAI prediction engine using PBP data as the primary source.

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research transformer architectures for sports prediction (sequence modeling)
- [ ] Design PBP tokenization strategy (event types, players, teams, scores)
- [ ] Define sequence representation format (game-level, season-level)
- [ ] Prototype embedding layer for basketball events
- [ ] Evaluate pre-training vs fine-tuning approaches
- [ ] Design output head for score/win probability prediction

**Key Decisions**:
- Input: Raw PBP sequences or GameStates snapshots?
- Architecture: Encoder-only (BERT-style) vs Decoder-only (GPT-style)?
- Training: Per-game prediction vs next-event prediction?

## 📋 Backlog

- **Core Pipeline Optimization**: Improve chunking strategy, memory management, and explore parallel processing opportunities in database_update_manager.py. See [Core Flowchart](diagrams/core_flowchart.drawio) for pipeline structure.
- **Historical Data Backfill**: PlayerBox/TeamBox (2000-2022, ~30K games), InjuryReports (Dec 2018-2023, ~900 PDFs/season)
- **Player Props Model**: Player-level predictions using PlayerBox data
- **Web App UX**: Auto-refresh for live games, mobile responsive, confidence intervals
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Structured logging, performance metrics, error alerting
