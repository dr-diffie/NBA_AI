schedule.py

Overview:
This module fetches and saves NBA schedule data for a given season. It consists of functions to:
- Fetch the schedule from the NBA API.
- Validate and save the schedule to a SQLite database.
- Ensure data integrity by checking for empty or corrupted data before updating the database.

Functions:
- update_schedule(season, db_path): Orchestrates fetching and saving the schedule.
- fetch_schedule(season): Fetches the NBA schedule for a specified season.
- save_schedule(games, season, db_path): Saves the fetched schedule to the database.
- main(): Handles command-line arguments to update the schedule, with optional logging level.

Usage:
- Typically run as part of a larger data collection pipeline.
- Script can be run directly from the command line (project root) to fetch and save NBA schedule data:
    python -m src.database_updater.schedule --season=2023-2024 --log_level=DEBUG
- Successful execution will print the number of games fetched and saved along with logging information.
