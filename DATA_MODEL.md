## Database Strategy

### Two-Database Architecture

The project maintains two SQLite databases:

| Database | Size | Seasons | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| `NBA_AI_dev.sqlite` | 2.8 GB | 2023-2026 | Active development (3 seasons) |
| `NBA_AI_ALL_SEASONS.sqlite` | 25 GB | 1999-2026 | Master archive (27 seasons) |

**Dev Database** (`NBA_AI_dev.sqlite`):
- Primary working database for all development
- Contains 3 seasons: 2023-2024, 2024-2025, 2025-2026
- **Strict subset of ALL_SEASONS** - all DEV data exists in ALL_SEASONS
- Set via `.env`: `DATABASE_PATH=data/NBA_AI_dev.sqlite`

**ALL_SEASONS Database** (`NBA_AI_ALL_SEASONS.sqlite`):
- 27 seasons of historical data (1999-2000 through 2025-2026)
- Unified schema matching DEV (consolidated Dec 2025)
- Contains all DEV data plus historical seasons
- Use for GenAI training on full historical dataset

### Data Availability by Season

| Data Type | Available From | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| PBP/GameStates | 2000-2001 | 1999-2000 predates NBA API |
| Betting | 2007-2008 | Pre-2007 not on Covers.com |
| InjuryReports | Dec 2018 | NBA Official PDFs started mid-2018-2019 |
| PlayerBox/TeamBox | 2023-2024 | Historical backfill deferred |

### Schema (Unified)

Both databases now share identical schema (13 tables):

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Games | Master schedule and collection status |
| PbP_Logs | Raw play-by-play JSON |
| GameStates | Parsed game state snapshots |
| Players | Player reference data |
| Teams | Team reference data |
| Features | Pre-game feature sets for ML |
| Predictions | Model predictions |
| ScheduleCache | Season schedule cache |
| PlayerBox | Player boxscore stats |
| TeamBox | Team boxscore stats |
| InjuryReports | NBA Official injury data |
| ESPNGameMapping | NBA→ESPN game ID mapping |
| Betting | Unified betting lines (single row per game) |

---

### Tables (13 total)

#### 1. Games (Master Schedule Table)
**Purpose**: Central table tracking all NBA games and their collection status

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Games" (
    game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- Format: 00223XXXXX (season/type/game#)
    date_time_est TEXT NOT NULL,           -- ISO 8601: "2024-10-22T19:30:00Z"
    home_team TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 3-letter abbreviation: "BOS", "LAL"
    away_team TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 3-letter abbreviation: "NYK", "MIA"
    status TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- "Scheduled", "In Progress", "Completed", "Final"
    season TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- "2023-2024", "2024-2025"
    season_type TEXT NOT NULL,             -- "Regular Season", "Post Season", "Pre Season", "All-Star"
    game_data_finalized BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,       -- PBP/GameStates complete
    boxscore_data_finalized BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- PlayerBox/TeamBox complete
    pre_game_data_finalized BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0    -- Features/predictions ready
);
```

**Key Fields**:
- `game_id`: Encodes season (chars 2-5) and game type (char 1)
  - `002` = Regular Season, `004` = Playoffs, `001` = Pre-Season, `003` = All-Star
- `game_data_finalized`: Set to 1 when **core PBP data** is collected:
  - PbP_Logs (at least one play)
  - GameStates (with is_final_state=1)
- `boxscore_data_finalized`: Set to 1 when **boxscore data** is collected:
  - PlayerBox (at least one player)
  - TeamBox (both teams present)
  - Note: Boxscores collected separately and can fail independently of PBP
- `pre_game_data_finalized`: Set to 1 when Features created (requires game_data_finalized=1)
- Note: Betting and InjuryReports are supplemental and do NOT gate any flags

**Status Values**: 
- "Scheduled" → "In Progress" → "Completed"/"Final"

---

#### 2. PbP_Logs (Raw Play-by-Play Data)
**Purpose**: Stores raw JSON play-by-play data from NBA API

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "PbP_Logs" (
    game_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    play_id INTEGER NOT NULL,              -- Action number/order from NBA API
    log_data TEXT,                         -- Raw JSON from NBA API
    PRIMARY KEY (game_id, play_id)
);
```

**Data Volume**: ~492 plays per game average  
**Source**: NBA CDN (live) or stats.nba.com (stats) endpoints

**log_data JSON Structure** (key fields):
```json
{
    "actionNumber": 1,
    "period": 1,
    "clock": "PT11M59.00S",           // ISO 8601 duration
    "scoreHome": "0",
    "scoreAway": "0",
    "actionType": "jumpball",
    "subType": "",
    "description": "Jump Ball...",
    "personId": 1630162,
    "playerName": "...",
    "teamTricode": "BOS"
}
```

---

#### 3. GameStates (Parsed Game Snapshots)
**Purpose**: Structured game state at each play (parsed from PbP_Logs)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "GameStates" (
    game_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    play_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    game_date TEXT,                        -- "2024-10-22"
    home TEXT,                             -- Home team tricode
    away TEXT,                             -- Away team tricode
    clock TEXT,                            -- "PT11M59.00S"
    period INTEGER,                        -- 1-4 (reg), 5+ (OT)
    home_score INTEGER,
    away_score INTEGER,
    total INTEGER,                         -- home_score + away_score
    home_margin INTEGER,                   -- home_score - away_score
    is_final_state BOOLEAN,                -- 1 if final play of game
    players_data TEXT,                     -- JSON: player stats at this moment
    PRIMARY KEY (game_id, play_id)
);
```

**Data Volume**: ~492 states per game (one per play)  
**Generated**: Parsed from PbP_Logs by `game_states.py`

**players_data JSON Structure**:
```json
{
    "home": {
        "1626167": {            // player_id as string key
            "name": "M. Turner",
            "points": 27
        },
        // ... ~9-10 players per team
    },
    "away": {
        "1630596": {
            "name": "E. Mobley",
            "points": 14
        },
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Note**: The `players_data` structure is minimal - only tracks player name and points accumulated. Full player stats are in `PlayerBox` table.

---

#### 4. PlayerBox (Player Boxscore Stats)
**Purpose**: Traditional boxscore statistics for each player per game

```sql
CREATE TABLE PlayerBox (
    player_id INTEGER NOT NULL,

    ft_pct REAL,                           -- Free throw percentage
    plus_minus INTEGER,                    -- Plus/minus
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, game_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES Games(game_id)
);
```

**Data Volume**: ~26 players per game  
**Source**: BoxScoreTraditionalV3 from nba_api

---

#### 5. TeamBox (Team Boxscore Stats)
**Purpose**: Team-level aggregate statistics per game

    FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES Games(game_id)
);
```

**Data Volume**: 2 records per game (home + away)  
**Source**: BoxScoreTraditionalV3 from nba_api

---

#### 6. Features (ML Feature Sets)
**Purpose**: Engineered features for machine learning models

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Features" (
    game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    feature_set TEXT,                      -- JSON: all features for this game
    save_datetime TEXT                     -- When features were created
);
```

**feature_set JSON Structure** (43 features total):
```json

- Differentials: Home vs Away comparisons
- Home/Away splits: Performance at home vs on road
- Time-decay: Recent games weighted more heavily
- Schedule: Rest days, game frequency

---

#### 7. Predictions (Model Predictions)
**Purpose**: Store predictions from various prediction engines

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Predictions" (
    game_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    predictor TEXT NOT NULL,               -- "Baseline", "Linear", "Tree", "MLP"
    prediction_datetime TEXT NOT NULL,     -- When prediction was made
    prediction_set TEXT NOT NULL,          -- JSON: all prediction outputs
    PRIMARY KEY (game_id, predictor)
);
```

**prediction_set JSON Structure**:
```json
{
    "pred_home_score": 115.92,
    "pred_away_score": 117.05,
    "pred_home_win_pct": 0.384,
    "pred_players": {
        "home": {},
        "away": {}
    }
}
```

**Predictors**:
- `Baseline`: Simple PPG-based formula (no ML)
- `Linear`: Ridge Regression on features
- `Tree`: XGBoost on features  
- `MLP`: PyTorch neural network
- `Ensemble`: Weighted average of Linear, Tree, MLP

---

#### 8. Players (Reference Table)
**Purpose**: Master list of all NBA players

```sql
CREATE TABLE Players (
    person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    full_name TEXT,
    from_year INTEGER,                     -- First season
    to_year INTEGER,                       -- Last season (NULL if active)
    roster_status BOOLEAN,                 -- Currently on roster?
    team TEXT                              -- Current team tricode
);
```

**Data Volume**: 5,115 players  
**Source**: NBA Stats API commonallplayers endpoint  
**Updated**: When schedule is updated for a season

**Note**: Biometric data (position, height, weight, age) was removed in Dec 2025 to simplify the pipeline. Player position is available in PlayerBox for each game.

---

#### 9. ScheduleCache (ETL Tracking)
**Purpose**: Track when schedule was last updated per season

```sql
CREATE TABLE ScheduleCache (
    season TEXT PRIMARY KEY,               -- "2024-2025"
    last_update_datetime TEXT NOT NULL     -- ISO 8601 timestamp
);
```

**Data Volume**: 1 row per season  
**Purpose**: Avoid redundant API calls for schedule data

---

#### 10. Teams (Reference Table)
**Purpose**: Master list of all NBA teams with name variations

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Teams" (
    team_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- NBA team ID: "1610612738"
    abbreviation TEXT NOT NULL,            -- "BOS"
    abbreviation_normalized TEXT NOT NULL, -- "bos"
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,               -- "Boston Celtics"
    full_name_normalized TEXT NOT NULL,    -- "boston celtics"

    short_name_normalized TEXT NOT NULL,   -- "celtics"
    alternatives TEXT,                     -- JSON: ["BOS", "Celts", ...]
    alternatives_normalized TEXT           -- JSON: ["bos", "celts", ...]
);
```

**Data Volume**: 30 teams  
**Purpose**: Handle name variations in text matching

---

#### 11. InjuryReports (NBA Official Injury Data)
**Purpose**: Store player injury status from NBA Official injury reports

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS InjuryReports (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    
    -- Player info
    nba_player_id INTEGER,                 -- NBA person_id (matches Players.person_id)
    player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    team TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Team tricode (NBA format: BOS, LAL)
    
    -- Injury status
    status TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- Out, Questionable, Doubtful, Probable, Available
    
    -- Injury details (parsed from NBA Official PDFs)
    injury_type TEXT,                      -- e.g., "Sprain", "Strain", "Soreness"
    body_part TEXT,                        -- e.g., "Knee", "Ankle", "Hand"
    injury_location TEXT,                  -- e.g., "Leg", "Arm" (broader category)
    injury_side TEXT,                      -- "Left", "Right", or NULL
    category TEXT DEFAULT 'Injury',        -- "Injury" or "Non-Injury" (Rest, Personal, etc.)
    
    -- Timing
    report_timestamp TEXT,                 -- Report date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    
    -- Metadata
    source TEXT DEFAULT 'NBA_Official',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_injury_team ON InjuryReports(team);
CREATE INDEX idx_injury_player ON InjuryReports(player_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_injury_timestamp ON InjuryReports(report_timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_injury_nba_player_id ON InjuryReports(nba_player_id);
```

**Data Source**: NBA Official daily injury PDFs  
**URL Pattern**: `https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_{YYYY-MM-DD}_05PM.pdf`  
**Historical Coverage**: 2023-2024 season to present (15,511 records)  
**Module**: `src/database_updater/nba_official_injuries.py`

**Key Fields**:
- `nba_player_id`: Links to Players.person_id (97.6% match rate achieved)
- `status`: Player availability (Out, Questionable, Doubtful, Probable, Available)
- `report_timestamp`: Date of the injury report

**Status Values**:
- `Out`: Player will not play
- `Doubtful`: Unlikely to play (< 25% chance)
- `Questionable`: Uncertain (50/50 chance)
- `Probable`: Likely to play (> 75% chance)
- `Available`: Cleared to play

**Usage Notes**:
- Collected automatically during pipeline runs for current season
- Daily PDF reports typically published at 5PM ET
- Player ID matching uses name normalization (handles Jr, III, IV, special chars)

---

#### 12. ESPNGameMapping (NBA→ESPN ID Mapping)
**Purpose**: Cache mapping between NBA game IDs and ESPN event IDs

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ESPNGameMapping (
    nba_game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    espn_event_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    game_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    home_team TEXT NOT NULL,
    away_team TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_espn_mapping_date ON ESPNGameMapping(game_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_espn_mapping_espn_id ON ESPNGameMapping(espn_event_id);
```

**Purpose**: Avoid repeated ESPN API lookups by caching ID mapping  
**Matching Logic**: Date + home_team + away_team (with team abbreviation normalization)

**Data Flow**:
1. Given NBA game_id, check ESPNGameMapping cache
2. If not cached, fetch ESPN scoreboard for game date
3. Match by teams (ESPN uses different abbreviations, NBATeamConverter handles this)
4. Cache mapping for future lookups

**Note**: This table supports ESPN data integration (used for betting data collection).

---

#### 13. Betting (Unified Betting Data - Single Row Per Game)
**Purpose**: Store closing betting lines (spreads, totals, results) for NBA games

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Betting (
    -- Primary key = one row per game
    game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                 -- NBA game_id (FK to Games)
    
    -- ESPN mapping (for Tier 1 fetches)

## Notes & Gotchas

1. **TEXT vs INTEGER IDs**: This project uses TEXT for game_id and team_id for simplicity, unlike the Custom_Model branch which used INTEGER foreign keys.

2. **Two PbP Sources**: Always try CDN first (faster, more reliable), fallback to Stats API for historical games.

3. **Clock Format**: NBA uses ISO 8601 duration (`PT11M59.00S`). Convert to seconds: `11*60 + 59 = 719 seconds`.

4. **Minutes Played**: Stored as REAL (float) in minutes. Convert from "MM:SS" format: `36:24` → `36.4` minutes.

5. **game_data_finalized Flag**: Only set to 1 when ALL of PbP_Logs, GameStates, PlayerBox, TeamBox are complete. Prevents partial updates.

6. **Features Dependency**: Cannot create features until both teams have prior game data. New season starts require games to complete first.

7. **Prediction Blending**: Live predictions blend pre-game prediction with current score based on time remaining. Formula: `blend_factor = (time_remaining / total_time)^2`

8. **Rate Limiting**: 0.6s sleep between BoxScore API calls to avoid connection pool warnings.

9. **Season Format**: APIs use abbreviated (`"2023-24"`) but database stores full (`"2023-2024"`).

10. **Status Values**: Games progress: `Scheduled` → `In Progress` → `Completed`/`Final`. Collection only happens when status is `Completed` or `Final`.

## Database Validation

### Overview

The database validation suite (`src/database_validator.py`) provides comprehensive automated checks across 9 categories to ensure data quality, logical consistency, and referential integrity. The suite includes 25+ validation checks with auto-fix capabilities for common issues.

### Usage

```bash
# Run all validators
python -m src.database_validator

# Run specific categories
python -m src.database_validator --categories flag,integrity,score

# Auto-fix issues
python -m src.database_validator --fix --categories flag

# Fix specific check
python -m src.database_validator --fix --check-id FLAG-001

# Output as JSON
python -m src.database_validator --output json > validation_report.json
```

### Validation Categories

#### 1. Flag Validator (`--categories flag`)
Validates finalization flag logic and consistency.

| Check ID | Severity | Description | Fixable |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| FLAG-001 | Critical | Games marked `game_data_finalized=1` without final GameState | ✓ |
| FLAG-002 | Critical | Games marked `game_data_finalized=1` without PBP data | ✓ |
| FLAG-003 | Critical | Games marked `pre_game_data_finalized=1` without Features | ✗ |
| FLAG-004 | Warning | Pre-game finalized but teams have no prior finalized games | ✗ |
| FLAG-005 | Critical | `pre_game_data_finalized=1` but `game_data_finalized=0` (logic error) | ✓ |
| FLAG-006 | Warning | Completed games with final state but `game_data_finalized=0` | ✓ |

**Common Issues**: Pre-season games marked finalized without actual data (FLAG-001, FLAG-002). Logic errors where pre-game finalized before game data (FLAG-005). First games of season have no prior states (FLAG-004 - expected).

#### 2. Team Validator (`--categories team`)
Validates team code consistency across tables.

| Check ID | Severity | Description | Fixable |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| TEAM-002 | Critical | GameStates home/away don't match Games table | ✗ |
| TEAM-003 | Warning | Team codes in Games not found in Teams reference table | ✗ |
| TEAM-004 | Critical | Active NBA teams missing from Teams reference table | ✗ |
| TEAM-005 | Critical | TeamBox team codes don't match Games table | ✗ |

**Verification**: NBA API is internally consistent - all PBP teamTricode values match Games table (verified Nov 2025). International teams from pre-season games (TEAM-003 - expected).

#### 3. Integrity Validator (`--categories integrity`)
Validates referential integrity and NULL values.

| Check ID | Severity | Description | Fixable |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| INTEGRITY-001 | Critical | PBP_Logs without matching Games record | ✓ |
| INTEGRITY-002 | Critical | GameStates without matching Games record | ✓ |
| INTEGRITY-003 | Critical | Features without matching Games record | ✓ |
| INTEGRITY-004 | Warning | Predictions without matching Games record | ✓ |
| INTEGRITY-005 | Critical | NULL values in critical fields | ✗ |
| INTEGRITY-006 | Critical | Duplicate GameStates (same game_id + play_id) | ✓ |

**Auto-fix behavior**: Deletes orphaned records and duplicate GameStates (keeps first occurrence).

#### 4. Score Validator (`--categories score`)
Validates score consistency and monotonicity.

| Check ID | Severity | Description | Fixable |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| SCORE-001 | Critical | Scores decreased within same period (non-monotonic) | ✗ |
| SCORE-002 | Critical | Negative scores detected | ✗ |
| SCORE-003 | Critical | Games with multiple different final scores | ✗ |
| SCORE-004 | Warning | Unrealistic score jumps (>10 points in one play) | ✗ |

#### 5. Volume & Temporal Validators
Additional checks for play counts (VOL-001, VOL-002), future games (TEMP-001), and chronological ordering (TEMP-002).

### Validation Workflow

**Pre-Data Collection**:
```bash
python -m src.database_validator --categories flag,integrity
```

**Post-Pipeline Run**:
```bash
python -m src.database_validator --categories flag,team,score
python -m src.database_validator --fix
```

**Expected Issues** (safe to ignore):
- FLAG-004: First games of season have no prior states
- TEAM-003: International teams from pre-season games

**Critical Issues** (require investigation):
- FLAG-005: Logic error in flag setting
- TEAM-002: GameStates don't match Games (data corruption)
- SCORE-001: Non-monotonic scores (API issue or parsing error)
- INTEGRITY-005: NULL values in critical fields
